# easy_weapon_accessories_v1
weapon accesories for esx


[INSTALLATION]


1) Import easy_weapon_mods_v1.sql in your database
2) Add this in your server.cfg :

```
start easy_weapon_accessories_v1 (or rename it, it doesn't effect anything.
```

3) Add these items to a shop. 

This script is a modified version of Eden_Accessories, I have converted it to english, and fixed the sql formatting as well as tidying the code up abit and adding more weapons to be supported.

Weapons also now save attachments.

Any problems let me know.
